# CTR-Prediction
# Click-Through Rate (CTR) Prediction - Kaggle Competition

## üìå Project Overview
This project involves performing **predictive analysis** to forecast **Click-Through Rate (CTR)** for display advertisements. The competition is hosted on **Kaggle**, where participants will submit their predictions and compare their model performance based on **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**.

The goal is to develop a **machine learning model** that accurately predicts CTR using a variety of features describing **ad quality, relevance, type, target audience, and content**. This project follows a structured workflow, including **data exploration, feature engineering, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation**.

## üîç Steps Involved

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Understand the dataset by inspecting variable types and distributions.  
   - Generate summary statistics and visualizations for insights.  
   - Identify missing values and potential transformations.  

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering**  
   - Handle missing values (imputation, mean centering, transformations).  
   - Convert categorical features into numerical representations.  
   - Perform feature selection to reduce overfitting.  

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Model Development & Evaluation**  
   - Train multiple predictive models (Linear Regression, Decision Trees, XGBoost, etc.).  
   - Tune hyperparameters for optimal performance.  
   - Evaluate model performance using **RMSE**.  

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Kaggle Submission**  
   - Generate CTR predictions for the test dataset.  
   - Submit predictions to Kaggle and compare against peers on the leaderboard.

## üéØ **Goal**
- **Predict Click-Through Rate (CTR) with high accuracy**.  
- **Minimize RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)** to improve ranking.  
- **Apply machine learning techniques** to optimize model performance.  

### üìå **Evaluation Metric: RMSE**
\[
RMSE = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2}
\]
Lower **RMSE** indicates a **better model**.
